As I write more posts about what I'm working on (or finished, let's say) I'll link to them here.

## Machine Learning

* Deep CNN in Keras/Theano
* Classical machine learning with Scikit-learn
* The latest and greatest with XGBoost

## Master's Thesis

Code on [Github](https://github.com/roryhr/profilometry)

## Bachelor's Thesis

The MATLAB code that implemented the image processing is
[here](https://github.com/roryhr/drop_splash).


## Other Fun Stuff

* I did some data exploration for Startup.ML on Taxis in Beijing. There are
  neat graphics in the [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/roryhr/taxi-trajectories/blob/master/taxi-data-notebook.ipynb) on my Github.
