<p>Fast Radius went public on the NASDAQ, trading as FSRD, on February 7, 2022.
Eight months later on November 7, 2022 Fast Radius <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001832351/000095017022022842/fsrd-20221104.htm">declared</a> bankruptcy. 
What happened? </p>
<h1>Origins</h1>
<p>Fast Radius started with 3D printing which was the hot thing at the time. </p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.builtinchicago.org/articles/fast-radius-raises-48m">Built in Chicago</a> on Apr. 02, 2019</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fast Radius Raises $48M, With Plans to Double Its Team</p>
<p>Once the domain of hobbyists and designers, 3D printing has entered the big leagues, and investors are taking notice.</p>
<p>Fast Radius, a Chicago-based digital manufacturing company, announced on Tuesday that it has raised a $48 million Series B round.</p>
<p>Chief Operating Officer Pat McCusker said Fast Radius will use the funding to bolster its software development and physical engineering efforts, build new manufacturing sites and grow its sales team.</p>
<p>“We have about 45 full-time employees, and we expect to double that in the next year or so,” said McCusker. “Most of that growth will happen in Chicago, and we’re really excited about that.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Fast Radius builds industrial-grade components — think airplane parts, medical equipment and custom car parts — using additive manufacturing, or 3D printing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Logistics titan UPS led Tuesday’s round, in which Drive Capital also participated. Previous investors Jump Capital, Skydeck and Hyde Park Venture Partners partook in Fast Radius’ Series B as well.</p>
<p>In addition to investing in Fast Radius, UPS has also partnered with the company to build a manufacturing facility at its WorldPort hub in Louisville, KY. The new facility would allow Fast Radius to build and ship parts much faster than it can now. </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In the "Summary Risk Factors" section from the ENNV proposal 
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1832351/000119312521295624/d182329ds4a.htm</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fast Radius may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
If Fast Radius fails to obtain additional capital on terms that are acceptable, it may not be able to implement such plans for business growth fully, if at all.      </p>
<p>Without obtaining adequate capital funding or improving its financial performance, Fast Radius may not be able to continue as a going concern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>January 16, 2022 (the “Amendment Effective Date”), Fast Radius and Lou Rassey entered into an amendment: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>would receive (i) a one-time cash bonus equal to $335,000 to be paid within five (5) business days following
the Amendment Effective Date and (ii) a one-time cash bonus equal to $2,065,000 to be paid within thirty (30) 
days following the closing of an initial public offering or transaction with a special purpose acquisition company.</p>
