Clearly, machine learning and artificial intelligence is useful. As someone who
has arrived in the field relatively recently, I wondered what the present state
of knowledge is.

The answer is not a lot.

My vision of the future of neural networks is like control theory. There's a
vast body of knowledge of research in the field which is about 100 years old.
For 90% of applications you just use a [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller). It's simple,
well-understood and works great.
