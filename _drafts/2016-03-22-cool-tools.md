Wouldn't it be nice if you could see the exact code you used to generate a plot
in a paper you wrote two years ago? Wouldn't it be nice to see the LaTeX you
used as well? Woudn't it be nice to see the Python code too? Wouldn't it be
even *nicer* for all of this code to be in one place?

# My take

I think it's an awesome tool. However, I don't need to write publications
anymore and sharing a Jupyter notebook is a fine way of sharing my results.
The notebooks are easy to use, support markdown and LaTeX, and the python
code is there for all to see.
