    <h1 class="entry-title">About</h1>
    
    <p>Rory Hartong-Redden is Data Engineer/Data Scientist.
My tools of choice are Python and Spark followed by SQL and Bash.
I work at Runtastic in Linz, Austria (acquired by adidas).</p>
<h1>Long Bio</h1>
<p>Rory Hartong-Redden, it's fair to say, is a native Californian. 
He was born in Los Angeles, grew up in the Bay Area, and visits his parents on the Central Coast. 
For a change of scenery he moved from Silicon Valley to Linz, Austria.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Runtastic Rory Hartong-Redden was a Data Scientist at Allstate in Menlo Park, CA. 
While at Allstate he collaborated with the Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab on autonomous vehicle safety.
The project was described in a recent <a href="https://www.allstatenewsroom.com/news/allstate-announces-autonomous-vehicle-research-agreement/">press release</a> and has resulted in several publications.</p>
<p>During the winter quarter of 2015 he was a machine learning fellow at <a href="Startup.ML">Startup.ML</a> where he built a data pipeline to Bitcoin data and set up a platform to backtest trading algorithms. 
Unfortunately he did anticipate Bitcoin blowing up the way it did (any model that held onto Bitcoin would have been profitable!).</p>
<p>Rory earned a bachelors degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara. 
His undergraduate research studied the structure of splashed using stereo high-speed cameras.
Rory completed a masters in Mechanical Engineering and continued to work in experimental fluid dynamics where he built a new fluid dynamics experiment that measured fluid motion using a novel computer vision system.</p>
