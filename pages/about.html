    <p>Rory Hartong-Redden is a data scientist and machine learning engineer in Boulder, Colorado. 
He's worked with all kinds of data leveraging his background in physics and engineering.  </p>

<h1>Long Bio</h1>
<p>In early 2020 Rory joined the manufacturing startup <a href="https://www.fastradius.com/">Fast Radius</a> as a data scientist where he worked in their Chicago office.
In 2021 Rory moved to Boulder, where he works 100% remotely, and was promoted to manager as the data science team grew. 
Fast Radius would go on to a <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/fast-radius-announces-completion-of-merger-with-ecp-environmental-growth">SPAC IPO</a> on February 7, 2022.
Just 8 months later the company declared <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/fast-radius-commences-chapter-11-to-complete-its-marketing-and-sale-process-2022-11">bankruptcy</a>. 
The remains of Fast Radius were bought at auction by a private equity firm and incorporated into a newly-formed company called SyBridge.</p>
<p>In 2018 Rory decided to move from Silicon Valley to Linz, Austria to work at <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/">runtastic</a>. 
At runtastic (now adidas runtastic) he was a data engineer working on data pipelines feeding internal analytics as well as product features.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Runtastic Rory Hartong-Redden was a data scientist at Allstate in Menlo Park, CA. 
While at Allstate he collaborated with the Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab on autonomous vehicle safety.
The project was described in a recent <a href="https://www.allstatenewsroom.com/news/allstate-announces-autonomous-vehicle-research-agreement/">press release</a> and has resulted in several publications.</p>
<p>During the winter quarter of 2015 he was a machine learning fellow at <code>Startup.ML</code> where he built a data pipeline to Bitcoin data and set up a platform to backtest trading algorithms. 
Unfortunately, he did predict Bitcoin blowing up.</p>
<p>Rory earned two bachelors degrees in Physics and Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara. 
His undergraduate research studied the structure of splashed using stereo high-speed cameras.
Rory completed a masters in Mechanical Engineering and continued to work in experimental fluid dynamics where he built a new fluid dynamics experiment that measured fluid motion using a novel computer vision system.</p>
