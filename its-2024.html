For fun let's review the last <a href="./its-2023.html">check-in</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'm using Firefox. ✅  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I adopted the <a href="https://github.com/psf/black">Black</a> code formatter. ✅</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I learned a lot of Elixir with Phoenix and Ecto. Plus some Rust. I like Elixir. ✅ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I became "Mr. Manager" (Well, manager; we just say manager.) ✅ </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>What's been going on?</h1>
<p>After surviving what feels like a dozen rounds of layoffs going into and out of bancrupcy, I was laid off from my "Mr. Manager" job along with just about everyone else at the end of May.
Stay tuned for "Part 3: Private Equity" to wrap up my time at Fast Radius. </p>
<h2>Job Search</h2>
<p>I remember prior job searches being painful but I wasn't able to put my finger on it until this time. 
The job search process is a sales process. 
Filling out a job application is like cold-calling.
You go through the same motions, "What problems do you have?" and you pitch yourself as someone who can solve their problems.</p>
<p>The problem is I'm not cut out for sales.
I don't like networking. 
I don't want to ask my colleagues for a job. 
I hate rejection, and unlike selling a SaaS product it's hard not to take rejection personally. 
And if you do end up being successful -- now you have to go to work! 
(This could be a Seinfeld bit.)</p>
<p>This analogy isn't novel but it explains why it's so tough. 
After all, I'm a data scientist and my skills revolve around analyzing data and building predictive models. 
But the sales hat is what you have to put on during a job search. 
It's not personal and you have to suck it up and start selling. </p>
<p>One piece of advice from the sales analogy comes again from Jerry Seinfeld who has a quote to the effect of, "I love being sold -- there's a romance to it. I enjoy getting a box and excitedly unwrapping it. It doesn't matter if the thing inside is disappointing because I enjoyed buying it." 
Romance is part of the sales process -- it should feel good to make a purchase.
The takeaway: the people who interview me should be excited to work with me.
They should think "He's great! I can't wait to work with him!" 
That's the idea, at least. </p>
<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>I created a makeshift "CRM" in a spreadsheet to keep track of applications. 
Note: in Colorado companies are required to post the salary range. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Company  Position   Date Applied    Response Date   Response    Salary Range    Job Link
</code></pre></div>

<p>I can filter on Response to see active applications. </p>
