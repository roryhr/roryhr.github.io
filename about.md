I'm currently a machine learning fellow at Startup.ML

Feel free to peruse my [resume](https://github.com/roryhr/resume/raw/master/rhartong-redden_resume.pdf)

## Short Bio

A thread running through my portfolio of work in academia, from astronomy to
fluid dynamics, is computer vision. For my master’s thesis I designed and
fabricated a fluid dynamics experiment that measured the state of the fluid
using a cutting edge computer vision system. Similarly, my bachelor’s thesis
work pioneered a measurement technique that collected data from splashes from
two high-speed cameras. Without a suitable theory to draw conclusions from my
measurements, I developed a new theoretical framework for my analysis.


As a physicist turned data scientist, I’m excited to be a fellow at Startup.ML
and to showcase my ability to work with data and machine learning methods.
