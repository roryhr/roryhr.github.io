I'm currently a machine learning fellow at [Startup.ML](Startup.ML)

I'd like leave San Francisco for somewhere colder in the
winter and stickier in the summer that's home to a certain
baseball team that hasn't won in a long time but I'll stay in the
Bay Area if I have to. I have a
[resume](https://github.com/roryhr/resume/raw/master/rhartong-redden_resume.pdf) that I lovingly crafted in LaTeX.

## Short Bio

A thread running through my academic portfolio, from astronomy to
fluid dynamics, is computer vision. For my master’s thesis I designed and
fabricated a fluid dynamics experiment that measured the state of the fluid
using a cutting edge computer vision system. Similarly, my bachelor’s thesis
work pioneered a measurement technique that collected data from splashes from
two high-speed cameras. Without a suitable theory to draw conclusions from my
measurements, I developed a new theoretical framework for my analysis.


As a physicist turned data scientist, I’m excited to be a fellow at Startup.ML
and to showcase my ability to work with data and machine learning methods.
