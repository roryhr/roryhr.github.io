This winter I was a machine learning fellow at [Startup.ML](Startup.ML) working on 
machine learning in finance. 

# Resume 
During my time in academia I learned LaTeX -- it's great. 
Below are pdf files of my one-page resume and two-page CV; I don't have a version in Microsoft Word.

# Short Bio

A thread running through my academic portfolio, from astronomy to
fluid dynamics, is computer vision. For my master’s thesis I designed and
fabricated a fluid dynamics experiment that measured the state of the fluid
using a cutting edge computer vision system. 
Similarly, my bachelor’s thesis
work pioneered a measurement technique that collected data from splashes from
two high-speed cameras. 
Without a suitable theory to draw conclusions from my
measurements, I developed a new theoretical framework for my analysis.
